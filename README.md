## The Game

FizzBuzz rules:
- The aim of the game is to count up as high as you can, starting at 1.
- If the next number is a multiple of 3, tap the "Fizz" button.
- If the next number is a multiple of 5, tap the "Buzz" button.
- If the next number is a multiple of 3 AND 5, tap the "FizzBuzz" button.

## Test Driven Development

TDD (Test Driven Development) is a way of writing software. At its core is a simple cycle: Write a test, write as little code as possible to make the test pass, and the refactor (tidy up) the code. It's a deceptively simple but powerful way to write code.
